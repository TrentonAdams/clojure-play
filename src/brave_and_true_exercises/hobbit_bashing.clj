(ns brave-and-true-exercises.hobbit-bashing)

; This is building the hobbit bashing game from Clojure for The Brave and True.
; It's from chapter 3 "Do Things".
; https://www.braveclojure.com/do-things/
; I highly recommend buying the book, if you're planning on learning Clojure.
; I also recommend not read this unless you have trouble building the functions
; with unit tests, but instead do it yourself.
